This android application was developed as a part of and Android AI App Development competition as a part of ICGAIFE (INTERNATIONAL CONCLAVE ON GENERATIVE AI AND THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION) conducted by IHRD.

On this special day of International Day of Sign Languages (23 September, 2023), we hope that our app even though at a very initial stage with many flaws help others understand and communicate 
with deaf and mute people around the world and encourage us to learn their language, hence bringing equal opportunities for them in their lives and eductaion with the helpof AI and technology.

PS: We have had certain hiccups in our development. Even with over 400+  data for every sign, some signs are hard to recognize. Thining about updating later but for the timebeing, uploading the files.
